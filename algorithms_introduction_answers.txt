Starbucks has mastered their algorithm for making coffee. They are one of the largest coffee chains in the country and continue to use the same coffee making algorithm they have been using.

Fender is a guitar manufacturer that has proven itself to be one the best guitars to get. The quality and workmanship that go into their guitar making algorithm is unmatched.

NVIDIA Geforce has made a name of itâ€™s own as far as GPUs go. The new algorithm for the RTX cards is still flawed, but lightyears ahead of any other competitor in the market.

I believe an efficient algorithm would be something that uses the least amount of steps and returns to best possible outcome. An inefficient algorithm would be if it had way too many steps to take for the same outcome.
